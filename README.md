# DistanceToVertexMap
Blender : Bake Distance Map as Vertex Color

This addon is part of the KYKEON Toolkit but it will be provided as a separate one, although after installation you may find it under the KYKEON tab in your 3D Viewport.

**How it works**

-Firstly select the object you want to bake the color info to and then pick the object which will be your distant point (if you don't pick any the addon will assume that this point is the center of your scene)

-Press the button BakeToVertex and check the result on Vertex Painting Mode.

Good Luck!
