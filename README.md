Blender : Bake Distance Map as Vertex Color

![alt text](https://github.com/cnisidis/DistanceToVertexMap/blob/master/preview_image.png?raw=true)


**How it works**

-Firstly select the object you want to bake the color info to and then pick the object which will be your distant point (if you don't pick any the addon will assume that this point is the center of your scene)

-Press the button BakeToVertex and check the result on Vertex Painting Mode.

Good Luck!
